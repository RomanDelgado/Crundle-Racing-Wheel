Welcome to the Custom Steering Wheel Development Project! This open-source initiative aims to design, build, and document a custom steering wheel compatible with Assetto Corsa Competizione. Our goal is to create a fully functional, ergonomic, and customizable steering wheel that attaches to the logitech 920 racing wheel.

Project Objectives:

Open-Source Design: All hardware designs, software code, and documentation are freely available.

Compatibility: Fully functional with Assetto Corsa Competizione and potentially other racing simulators. The column of the wheel is going to be the logitech 920

Community Collaboration: Encourage contributions and feedback from the sim racing community.
Features
Force Feedback: Realistic force feedback mechanisms for an immersive driving experience.
Customizable Inputs: Configurable buttons, paddles, and rotary encoders.
Display Units: Integration of display screens for telemetry and in-game data.
Ergonomic Design: Focus on comfort with adjustable components and optimized grip.
Modular Architecture: Easy to upgrade and customize with additional features.
